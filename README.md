Everyone who is preparing DSA is well known about the platform called LeetCode But the problem is, it has a lot of questions to practice around 2k+ which needs a lot of time to solve and no one really likes spending that much time.

The Solution -
One technique that people often follow is to solve questions related to the same data structure; for example, focusing on questions related to Arrays, then LinkedList, HashMap, Heap, Tree, or Trie, etc.

I have gathered around 20 of these coding problem patterns that I believe can help anyone learn these beautiful algorithmic techniques and make a real difference in the coding interviews.

1) Sliding Window
2) Islands (Matrix Traversal)
3) Two Pointers
4) Fast & Slow Pointers
5) Merge Intervals
6) Cyclic Sort
7) In-place Reversal of a LinkedList
8) Tree Breadth-First Search
9) Tree Depth First Search
10) Two Heaps
11) Subsets
12) Modified Binary Search
13) Bitwise XOR
14) Top ‘K’ Elements
15) K-way Merge
16) Topological Sort
17) 0/1 Knapsack
18) Fibonacci Numbers
19) Palindromic Subsequence
20) Longest Common Substring

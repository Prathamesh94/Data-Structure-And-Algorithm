Problems:

>Lecture-1
1. Merge Interval
2. Rain water trapping
3. Max sum subarray

>Lecture-2
4. Given Q queries ,find sum of submatrix, you are given top left and bottom right
5. Given  a  matrix find max submatrix sum   ->try with each row 0-n-1 as starting point Sum of rows from top to bottom and apply kadanes Algorithm

>Lecture-3
6. Find max j-i such that A[j]>=A[i]  -> Using sorting storing index with it and find left min to find max j-i
7. Given a matrix of size mxn find sum of all submatrix sums?? -> Find prefix matrix sum and take sum of it
8. Given 2D Matrix ,every row sorted every column sorted. Find element k?? -> Do Binary search to row to find row then binary search on column

>Lecture-4
9. For given decimal number N, check if ith bit is set or not? -> Perform n right shift and check if it is a set bit , ((N >> i)&1 ==1)
10. Given a decimal number,count the number of set bits in it? -> Check bit for each bits for 32 bit number
11. Given N array elements every element repeat twice expect one ,find unique element?  -> do xor of all numbers
12. Given N array elements every element repeat thrice expect one ,find unique element? -> count bit at position for all number and mod it with 3 ,  then that is bit of unique number for that position

>Lecture-5
13. Given N elements, every element repeats twice expect 2 unique elements, Find 2 unique elements? where arr[i] >=0
    Solution : 1. XOR of all elements gives XOR of two elements
               2. Create two buckets based of elements based on set bit and non set bit at given position
               3. Now we can solve both bucket same as question 11 to get two unique elements
14. Given N elements, array contains all elements from 1 to n+2 except 2 elements .find 2 missing elements? ->
15. Given N elements, calculate sum of xor of  all pairs

Isolation level
read uncommitted
    no isolation => all the read phonomena can occur
    any change from the other transaction is visible in the rest of the transactions happening at the
    same time
read committed
    each query in a transaction only see the committed stuff (at the time of the query)
    dirty read canʼt occur because youʼre not reading any dirty change
repeatable-read
    each query in a transaction ONLY SEES the committed changes at the beginning of the
    transaction
serialisable
    all the transactions are bound to happen without any concurrency
    you are not allowed to have parallel transactions


Phantom read problem
TX1ʼs step1 took place => Product 1 -> 50, Product 2 -> 80 TX2ʼs step1 occurred TX2 got committed
In middle of TX1 product 3 came into the sale
TX1ʼs step2 => Total sale amt => 140

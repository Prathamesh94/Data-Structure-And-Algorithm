Round 1:
Duration: 60mins
Was interviewed by an external agency.

Questions asked:
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/
----------------
Scheduled next rounds after clearing this.

1.Tickerlson problem - Given an array of integers with size N . A operation is defined as : Choose any indexes of array , say x and y (0<=x <=y <=N-1) and inverting all the elements between them ( basically making arr[i] as -arr[i] ) . We can do this operation at most two times .We have to evaluate maximum subarray sum . Example - [2 , -19 ,-1,3,-39,-1,5,-2] operation on (1,2) and (4,5) gives maximum subaray sum as 70.

2.This problem was realted to n-ary tree . min time required to pass information to all nodes from root node. (can be found on gfg).

3.We are given a map with n cities and n-1 roads ,each road connecting two cities bidirectionally . Each city is either infected or not . Infection-spread is defined as absolute difference between no of infected and non-infected cities . We want to cut out a submap of cities with maximum infection-spread .

Can anyone help me in first and third question?

--------------
1st Round
Question asked was from LeetCode itself.
1. number of islands
2. Unique BST 2

Had to solve both questions completely in an hour.

2nd Round
It was an LLD round, Was asked to design BMS (BookMyShow).
This was my first LLD round, glad to have an easy question for this.

3rd Round
Started with Project discussion.
Had 30 min disucssion on that.
Then moved ahead with Problem Solving.

Was asked to design API, to search a bus based on source, Destination, Date.
Also, to register bus along with iternary.
Interviewer was not focused on using any framework as such.
He was mostly concerned on problem solving and how we can optimize our approach.
Later asked me to code it.
I wrote the code, along with logging and exception handling. Taking care of naming conventions as well.

---------------
Round1. Coding- basic string question....given a string find its lexicographic order number ....eg - A = 1, Z = 26, AA = 27 etc, this round went well
Round2. Coding - Median of two sorted arrays, basic pattern printing, the round went well

Round3. Basic resume discussion - 1 hour discussion on past projects, the round went well

Round4- Hight level design of trending tweets in twitter

Round5- HM round, behaviour questions


---------------------
DSA Round (via some external agency) -
2 LC Medium (Had to share my screen + submit in LC itself) - As I wasn't able to solve one, I got mixed feedback but HR still advanced me to the next round
Problems -

LLD Round (via some external agency) - Parking Lot

System Design -
Detailed in depth discussion on a system in my resume
Detailed in depth discussion on a system to design (Great interview and interviwer, went on for over 1.5hrs)

LLD - LLD for a cards game (Hearts, I think)

HM - Cultural fit + behavioural

Dear colleagues,

It is with a heavy heart that I write to inform you that I will be leaving Reliance Jio after six incredible years with the company.

As my first job out of college, Reliance Jio provided me with an incredible opportunity to learn, grow, and make a real impact on the business. I am grateful to have had the chance to work on the Jio B2B, Jio Fibre, Jio POS, and Jio Mobility businesses, and I am proud of the contributions I was able to make to each of these teams.

I am also grateful to have had the chance to work with such a talented and dedicated group of colleagues. Your guidance, support, and friendship have meant the world to me and have helped me to grow both personally and professionally.

Leaving Reliance Jio is bittersweet for me, as I will always look back on my time here with great appreciation and fondness. However, I am excited for the next chapter in my career and am confident that the skills and experiences I gained at Reliance Jio will serve me well in my future endeavors.

I will be leaving the company at the end of this month and will be happy to assist with the transition in any way that I can.

Again, thank you all for your support and mentorship over the years. It has been an absolute pleasure working with you and I will always be grateful for my time at Reliance Jio.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Hi Pankaj,

Hope you are doing good.

I want few inputs from you, one company is processing the offer which is providing 110% on above fixed and about 80% hike on overall CTC(40LPA).
Work Culture: Good
Technical Opportunities : It is better than current company work but I am looking for opportunity which provide me more challenging problems to be solved.
WFH/WFO :  Work From Home

Currently I am thinking to go ahead with this offer considering I have 90 days notice period and already 3-4 companies are process are already in progress I should be able to get better opportunity in next 3 months.

I havenâ€™t started applying to tier-2 or tier-1 company yet planning to start it next(3-4 days).

Let me know what do you think about it.

Regards
Prathamesh Mhatre

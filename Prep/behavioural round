Situation : We were suppose to migrate 2000+ Services to nodejs from vendor product, but only live apis which are in use we are suppose to migrate only that services. We asked operationals team to get production traffic data based on which we were suppose to perform migration.

For B2C segment we consumer didn't had any SIT environment due to which it was difficult of perform testing in SIT before promoting change to replica.

Task: We decide to listdown API with their consumer and discuss with consumer to perform testing and coordinate proactively to ensure testing in done

Action:
We had design walkthrough with all stake holders , We shot a mail to consumer that we will be deploying in SIT on xx date we are expecting signoff by this date.

Conclusion/Result:
It was a difficult task but following up with every consumer we were able get testing done for 80% of application for few application as they were not available in SIT to decided to move in to replica and 95% testing was covered in replica .For 5% cases what we did is in production we did configuration on LB based on sourceip we will route traffic to nodejs rest all will be served by vendor product.This ensure impact only on tester device and rest all is working fine.If testing goes well we plan in phase wise manner zone wise.

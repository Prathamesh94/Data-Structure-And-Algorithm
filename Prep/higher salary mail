Dear [Employer],

Thank you for offering me the position of [Job Title] at [Company]. I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and contribute to the success of the company.

I am writing to express my interest in discussing the possibility of an increase in salary, based on my current market value and other competing offers that I have received.

As you can see from my resume, I have a strong track record of success in the industry and have consistently delivered high-quality work for my previous employers. I believe that my skills and experience make me a valuable asset to your team and warrant a higher salary.

I have recently received competing offers from other companies that recognize my value and are willing to pay a higher salary to secure my services. While I am excited about the opportunity to join [Company], I also have to consider my own financial needs and what is fair compensation for my level of experience and expertise.

I hope that we can discuss this matter further and find a mutually beneficial solution. I am confident that with a higher salary, I will be able to make significant contributions to the success of [Company] while also being fairly compensated for my work.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to discussing this further with you and becoming a valuable member of the [Company] team.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
